Customtkinter GUI for connecting and disconnecting instruments.
You can go to the “GUI_Scripts” folder and copy the “Instrument Connect and Disconnect GUI” folder.
In the main.py you can see a simple example of how the connect and disconnect functions work. 
Please read the documentation (https://martinmiroslavovmihaylov.github.io/Python_Instruments_Automation_Scripts/), because 
You will need some Python libraries to be installed so that you can use all the functions in this package.  


The Live Update extention for the GUI is still in development and since is not a preority will take a while
